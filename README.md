This project is a comparison of the R-squared score of four different machine learning model types on the same dataset. The dataset is a house sale dataset which includes features that describe aspects of a home (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/animeshparikshya/house-sale-data-81-column?select=test.csv). The goal of the models is to predict the prices of the homes. The models used are multiple linear regression, ridge, lasso, and an artificial neural network. 

Although linear, ridge, and lasso regression vary in their R-squared score on different train/test splits of the dataset, the artificial neural network always remains relatively consistant and the best performing at 0.88. Linear and ridge are nearly identical in R-squared score, with the alpha selected for ridge making little difference. Lasso always performs the worst regardless of selected alpha value. This is likely because none of the selected features from the dataset are irrelevant, but lasso is feature selecting anyway.
