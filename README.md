This project is a comparison of four different machine learning model types on the same dataset. The dataset is a house sale dataset which includes features that describe aspects of a home (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/animeshparikshya/house-sale-data-81-column?select=test.csv). The goal of the models is to predict the prices of the homes. The models used are multiple linear regression, ridge, lasso, and an artificial neural network. 

Although linear, ridge, and lasso regression vary in accuracy on different train/test splits of the dataset, the artificial neural network always remains relatively consistant and the best performing at 88% accuracy. Linear and ridge are nearly identical in accuracy, with the alpha selected for ridge making little difference. Lasso always performs the worst regardless of selected alpha value. This is likely because the none of the selected features from the dataset is irrelevant, but lasso is feature selecting anyway.
